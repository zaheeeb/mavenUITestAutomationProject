# Mondia Test Automation Project

This project is aimed to UI automate scenarios mentioned in the documentation of task for an e-commerce site with the help of Selenium and TestNG in Maven Project.

## Tools
Following tools are used to complete this task.
1. Eclipse ID
2. TestNG   
3. Selenium 4.1
4. Selenium IDE
5. Chromedriver

## Setting up tools and executing test cases
1. Open Eclipse
2. Create Maven project
3. Update pom.xml with the Selenium dependencies
4. Refresh the project so JRE System Library shows selenium libraries are imported.
5. Create new test case.
6. Click on Run button of Eclipse to execute the test cases.

## Notes
1. Worked first time in Maven and TestNG. It was tiring but rewarding to complete this task in totally new framework.
2. Tried to be structured within the project but test and file name might be basic.
2. Spent many hours to try to add item to cart by using movetoElement method but didn't have success. When you run test case and reach to list of adds please move mouse manually over the items and then it finds element to add it to cart.
3. Couldn't test change shipping method because there was only one option to select.
